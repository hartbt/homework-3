# **Description**

This assignment serves as a password generator for an employee who has access to sensitive data. The employee is able to select certain criteria (using confirms) that they want to be included within the password, such as:
*UpperCase characters
*LowerCase characters
*Numbers
*Special Characters

The user is also able to select how many characters they would like to be included within the password. 

After the criteria is selected, the password will be randomly generated (following the selected criteria) using a list of functions that are linked to an array for each criteria.

# **Usage**

When the webpage is loaded, select the "Generate Password" button. The user will then be prompted with a prompt asking how many characters they want their password to contain. After inputing a number within the given criteria, the user will then be given confirms to determine what criteria they want their password to contain. After the final confirm is answered, the generator will automatically populate the given area.

# **Technologies Used**

Within this website, there are components from html, css styling, as well as javascript. 

Using html, the website layout is dictated, and the CSS page gives style to the HTML elements. 

Javascript is the biggest piece of this of this assignment, and using different elements like assigning variables, creating for loops, and then utilizing those for loops within this function, the user is able to create a randomly generated password. 

# **Problems Faced**

This assignment was very difficult to complete, and I would not have been able to do so without the help of my tutor and my classmates. 

The first issue that I came across was where to start after defining all of the arrays and variables that I had planned on using within the function.

I then struggled with creating working 'if' statements within the function. 

# **Credits**

Though this website was created by me, it was only done so using knowledge provided by my instructor, TA's, my tutor, as well as many of my classmates.
